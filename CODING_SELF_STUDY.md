# Coding Self-Study Resources

This is a list of free materials to practice coding and learn Computer Science. These topics are generally not language specific but each language might have a slightly different take on implementing some of these concepts.

## Coding Exercises

These provide programming exercises that you can try and solve. Useful if you want to practice for a coding interview!

## Specific Topics

There's a lot of resources for the same topics available online. I've chosen a diverse bunch for the links here in no particular order. Some of the links are not entirely comprehensive, they may just be an intro to the larger topic. If you decide you like a specific content provider, feel free to stick with it instead of following the links. Also, I find the best method for me to understand some of these concepts is to actually implement it.
